##### YES. Plant protein bar
Surprisingly tasty and crunchy. Would buy again. Had the almond version. 

##### Maltesers Instant Hot Chocolate
It’s hot chocolate, what’s not to love. I ignored their recommendation of using water and it was still good. But I prefer my hot chocolate powder from Lidl.

##### Reese’s Peanut Butter Minis
Too good. We devoured them in under 20 min. 

##### Flapjack
Tina - Good for a lazy snack. But it’s bigger than one thinks, so not for mini-peckish moments

##### Chocolate crepes
Tina - A bit dry and tasteless. Warm they were definitely better but still not great

##### Costa Coffee
Harvy - Pretty much like millicano, I suspect you can't improve on nearly-instant coffee anymore.

##### Cashew and Oat Cookie
Harvy - Great little cookiie, wish it was bigger but then it's good portion control. 

##### Pretzels

##### Attack a Snak

##### Kitkat senses

##### Brioche Burger Buns
