September is here.

##### Hartley’s Jelly Pot
Tina - “There is always room for Jello” and Bill Murray was right. Nice jello, like all jello. 

Harvey - I don’t think I had this

##### Mc Vities’s 
Normally not a fan of orange flavoured cookies but these were nice. Good mix of crunchiness, gooiness and chocolate taste. 

Harvey - Tina have you been eating all these? Pretty sure I didn’t have this either. /whispers I did it was great. Slightly chewy but the taste and texture made up for that.

##### Emily Veg Thins
Interesting alternatives for crisps, crunchy and nice tastes. 

Harvey - I stayed away from these.

##### Peter’s Yard Original Sourdough Crispbread
Nice take on the cracker, good with smelly cheese and a drop of sour marmalade. Yum yum. 

##### FULFIL Chocolate Hazelnut Whip Bar
Tina - Nice and smooth, very indulgent and not too bad on the calorie count. 

Harvy - Agree very smooth and just the right mix of textures and flavours.

##### Whitworths Chocolate Biscuit & Hazelnut Treat Mix
Tina - The bits and pieces were not bad, but the mix of raisins and nuts and chocolate freaks me out. I want to know if it is crispy, sweet or gooey and salty before i bite on it, even if I chuck them down without looking.

Harvy - Really like the mix of different but complimentary snacks. Just shove a load in your mouth and let it all mix up.

##### Thatchers Cloudy Lemon Cider

Harvy - Surprisingly a refreshing drink that's good for the summer days/nights. Reminds me of a bottled [radler from germany](https://germanfoods.org/recipes/radler/)

##### Chicken Yakisoba

##### More Maple syrup, this time mini
Did we even use this? It's probably just disappeared

##### Vegetable Barley soup

##### Lucozade
