This is a big one, like multiple times too big.

First up let's start with the classic degusta box

##### Pipers crisps
Tina - The cheesy one was nicely cheesy. The thyme and rosemary was rather different, good for a small portion but would eat too many of them.

##### Odysea Aubergine Meze Dip


##### Leon Aioli vegan
Tina - Despite the vegan, nice taste and good consistency. The jar is a bit tall and getting the last stuff out is tricky but worth it.

##### Brave Roasted Chickpeas
Tina - Nice and crunchy, good taste. 

##### Dash Water


##### Cocoa caramel peanuts


##### CLUB Tropica IPA
Great IPA, I’ve added to my beer app.

##### Good Earth Tea
Tina - not tried yet, too much other tea at home

##### Peter’s Yard Sourdough Bites
Tina - the Sourdough taste was good but a bit too much on the salty side. 


##### Nexba Pineapple soft
Harvy - Was alright. Could have it again, would be a good summer drink.

##### Capsicana cooking paste
Tina - We made it with chicken and it was juicy, fruity and spicy at the same time. Would recommend.

##### Tony’s Chocolonely
Tina - rather nice and rich taste. I only had a bite but it was a good one.
